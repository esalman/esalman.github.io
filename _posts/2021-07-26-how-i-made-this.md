title: How I Made This
---

My old website used to be on PHP Zend framework. 
I worked a lot with that framework back in the day, so it was a good little exercise. 
But now being the 2020s it needed a refresh with more up-to-date technologies.
I looked around, and while React and other frameworks are all the rage now, it seemed too much for a little personal website.
Instead I turned to Jekyll which can be hosted for free on Github.

I am not going to give a walk-through of the whole process in one page because there are lots of different techs involved. 
Instead let's make a list of things that that can be expanded on later in multiple posts. 
Here goes the list:

- VS Code and Git SDK for development 
- Jekyll and setup for local testing
- Git/Github for pushing the website to live
- Domain and email
